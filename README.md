# RoadMap
Structured roadmap for learning Python specifically for Data Science

1. Fundamentals of Python
   
>>Basic Syntax and Data Types

>>Variables, data types (int, float, string, bool), type casting

>>Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries

>>Control Flow

>>Conditionals (if, elif, else)

>>Loops (for, while)

>>Functions

>>Defining functions, arguments, return values, lambda functions

**2. Advanced Python Concepts

>>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

>>Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism

>>Modules and Packages

>>Importing modules, using standard libraries

>>Error Handling

>>Try, except, finally

**3. Data Manipulation

>>NumPy

>>Arrays, array operations, broadcasting, slicing

>>Pandas

>>DataFrames, series, reading/writing data (CSV, Excel, SQL), data cleaning, merging/joining data

**4. Data Visualization

>>Matplotlib

>>Plotting basics, line plots, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots

>>Seaborn

>>Statistical plots, aesthetics, customization

>>Plotly

>>Interactive visualizations

**5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

>>Descriptive Statistics

>>Mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation

>>Data Cleaning

Handling missing values, outliers, duplicates

Data Transformation

Scaling, encoding categorical variables

**6. Machine Learning
Scikit-Learn

Supervised learning (regression, classification)

Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)

Model evaluation and validation

**7. Advanced Topics
Deep Learning

Introduction to neural networks, using TensorFlow or PyTorch

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, topic modeling

Time Series Analysis

ARIMA, exponential smoothing, LSTM networks

**8. Project Work
Kaggle Competitions
